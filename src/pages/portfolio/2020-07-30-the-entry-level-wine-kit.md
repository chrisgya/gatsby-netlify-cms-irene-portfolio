These wines represent the 'essential' wines every wine list should have and were sold as a kit.

We selected the wines from our existing portfolio and rebranded them under different names and labels to meet our customers' needs.

The selection includes 'classics' like New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, Piemonte Cortese or Argentinian Malbec.

I worked on the development of the concepts, naming and marketing support of the new brands.
