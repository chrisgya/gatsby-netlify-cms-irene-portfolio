During almost two years, I managed the development of a complete new website for [Boutinot Wines UK.](http://www.boutinot.com)

My work involved working with a digital agency and the in-house IT and design teams.

The new website is synched with the Microsoft AX back-end system, where all the product, producer and customer information is fed from. It also includes an e-commerce platform where customers can place orders online, check invoices and previous orders and see specific channel and account promotions.

The second phase of the project which I led, involved the development of two mirror sites for different markets (US & Export).

One of the main requirements for the new website was that it had to show new information daily. We wanted it to be the main source of information about our wines for our customers, and therefore it had to show the latest on the products. This was well reflected both on the home page and the wine and producer pages.

Also, we wanted it to be a reflection of the company's values: young, exciting, and anything but your same old web.
